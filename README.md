## Game Programming
### Assignment 1

#### Text based game v1.0
The aim of this assignment was to use C++ to implement a game with Object Oriented Classes for Player and Enemy that inherit from a GameCharacter class, a Game class with 4 enemy and 1 player pointer objects stored in a list of pointers to Game Characters, A main.cpp file is used to create a Game object call the init() function of the Game Class, and loop 20 times through the render(), update(), battle(), stats(), and clean() functions, before printing the Game Characters details to the screen a final time using the stats() function.

The classes are separated into header files for definitions, and the functions of the classes are contained in .cpp files. Object-Oriented Programming techniques are used in this assignment to achieve required functionality.

* GameCharacter class
* Enemy and Player classes that inherit from GameCharacter
* Game Loop
